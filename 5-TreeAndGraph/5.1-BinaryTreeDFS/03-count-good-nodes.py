# ===== Analysis =====
# Time complexity: O(n) where n is the number of nodes

# Space complexity: proportional to the height of the tree
# - worst case: O(n) when the tree is a straight line
# - best case: Î©(log n) when the tree is 'complete'

# complete tree: all nodes have 0 or 2 children and each level except the last is full
