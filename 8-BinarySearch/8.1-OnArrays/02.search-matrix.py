# Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value 'target' in an m x n integer matrix 'matrix'.
# Integers in each row are sorted from left to right.
# The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.

# ===== Analyze =====
# - each row is sorted and all numbers are less than numbers in the next row
#   -> we can treat the matrix as 1 array to perform binary search
# - now we need to map the index of the hypothetical array to the correct row and col
#   + the row increment every n indices -> row = i // n
#   + the column reset to 0 every n indices -> col = i % n

    n = len(matrix[0])  # number of columns

    # indices on the hypothetical array
    left = 0
    right = m * n - 1
