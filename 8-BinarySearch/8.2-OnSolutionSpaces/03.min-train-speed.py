# You are given a floating-point number hour,
# representing the amount of time you have to reach the office.
# To commute to the office, you must take n trains in sequential order.
# You are also given an integer array dist of length n,
# where dist[i] describes the distance (in kilometers) of the ith train ride.
#
# Each train can only depart at an integer hour,
# so you may need to wait in between each train ride.
#
# For example, if the 1st train ride takes 1.5 hours,
# you must wait for an additional 0.5 hours before you can depart on the 2nd train ride at the 2 hour mark.
# Return the minimum positive integer speed (in kilometers per hour)
# that all the trains must travel at for you to reach the office on time,
# or -1 if it is impossible to be on time.
#
# Tests are generated such that the answer will not exceed 10^7
# and hour will have at most two digits after the decimal point.

# Example 1:
# Input: dist = [1,3,2], hour = 6
# Output: 1
# Explanation: At speed 1:
# - The first train ride takes 1/1 = 1 hour.
# - Since we are already at an integer hour, we depart immediately at the 1 hour mark. The second train takes 3/1 = 3 hours.
# - Since we are already at an integer hour, we depart immediately at the 4 hour mark. The third train takes 2/1 = 2 hours.
# - You will arrive at exactly the 6 hour mark.

# Example 2:
# Input: dist = [1,3,2], hour = 2.7
# Output: 3
# Explanation: At speed 3:
# - The first train ride takes 1/3 = 0.33333 hours.
# - Since we are not at an integer hour, we wait until the 1 hour mark to depart. The second train ride takes 3/3 = 1 hour.
# - Since we are already at an integer hour, we depart immediately at the 2 hour mark. The third train takes 2/3 = 0.66667 hours.
# - You will arrive at the 2.66667 hour mark.

# Example 3:
# Input: dist = [1,3,2], hour = 1.9
# Output: -1
# Explanation: It is impossible because the earliest the third train can depart is at the 2 hour mark.

# Constraints:
# n == dist.length
# 1 <= n <= 10^5
# 1 <= dist[i] <= 10^5
# 1 <= hour <= 10^9
# There will be at most two digits after the decimal point in hour.


# ===== Analyze =====
# - Let k the speed of (all) the trains.
#   If a train has distance d then the time is d / k.
#   The trains only depart at integer hour, so we need to round the time up.
#   The last ride doesn't need rounding because we don't need to wait for another train.
#
# - We can perform a binary search for the speed k.
#   + lower bound: 1 (k must be a positive integer)
#   + upper bound: 10^7 (in problem constraints)
# - If a speed k is possible, try a smaller value. Otherwise try a larger one.
#
# - Since each train ride takes at least 1 hour, if there more trains than hours allowed,
#   it is impossible to find an answer.
#   But the last train can take fractional time (no more waiting),
#   so we should compare number of trains with hours rounded up.

# ===== Complexity =====
# Let n = dist.length; k = max possible answer (10^7 in this case)
#
# 1. Time complexity
# - check runs in O(n)
# - binary search runs in O(log(k))
# => Overall: O(n*log(k))
#
# 2. Space complexity: O(1)
