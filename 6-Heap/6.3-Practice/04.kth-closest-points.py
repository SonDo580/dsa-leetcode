# Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi]
# represents a point on the X-Y plane and an integer k,
# return the k closest points to the origin (0, 0).

# The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance (i.e., âˆš(x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2).

# You may return the answer in any order.
# The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in).

# Example 1:
# Input: points = [[1,3],[-2,2]], k = 1
# Output: [[-2,2]]
# Explanation:
# The distance between (1, 3) and the origin is sqrt(10).
# The distance between (-2, 2) and the origin is sqrt(8).
# Since sqrt(8) < sqrt(10), (-2, 2) is closer to the origin.
# We only want the closest k = 1 points from the origin, so the answer is just [[-2,2]].

# Example 2:
# Input: points = [[3,3],[5,-1],[-2,4]], k = 2
# Output: [[3,3],[-2,4]]
# Explanation: The answer [[-2,4],[3,3]] would also be accepted.

# Constraints:
# 1 <= k <= points.length <= 10^4
# -10^4 <= xi, yi <= 10^4

# ===== Implementation =====
# - Keep adding points along with distance from origin to a max heap
#   (simulate a max heap by negating the value)
# - When the heap size exceed k, pop the element with largest distance
# - Retrieve and return the remaining points in the heap at the end

import heapq


def k_closest_points(points: list[list[int]], k: int) -> list[list[int]]:
    heap = []

    for point in points:
        x, y = point
        distance_squared = x**2 + y**2

        heapq.heappush(heap, (-distance_squared, point))
        if len(heap) > k:
            heapq.heappop(heap)

    return [item[1] for item in heap]

# ===== Complexity =====
# Time complexity:
# - n iterations:
#   + heap operations: O(log(k))
# - produce result list from the heap: O(k) 
# => overall: O(n*log(k) + k)
#
# Space complexity: 
# - O(k) for the heap
# - O(k) for the result list
# => overall: O(k)
