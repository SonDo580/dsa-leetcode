# ===== Key idea =====
# - Repeatedly swap adjacent elements if they're in the wrong order.
# - After each pass, the largest element "bubbles up" to the end.


def bubble_sort(arr: list[int]) -> list[int]:
    n = len(arr)
    
    for i in range(n):
        swapped = False

        # The last i elements are already in place
        for j in range(0, n - i - 1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j + 1]:
                arr[j], arr[j + 1] = arr[j + 1], arr[j]
                swapped = True

        # Optimization: no swaps in this pass -> array is sorted
        if not swapped:
            break

    return arr


# ===== Complexity =====
# 1. Time complexity:
# - Best case: O(n)
#   + If the array is already sorted, no swaps occur in the first pass
#     -> only loop through the array once
#     -> O(n)
# - Average/Worst case: O(n^2)
#   + Pass 1: n - 1 comparisons
#   + Pass 2: n - 2 comparisons
#   + ...
#   + Pass n - 1: 1 comparison
#   -> Total: 1 + 2 + ... + (n - 2) + (n - 1) = n * (n - 1) / 2
#   -> O(n^2)
# 
# 2. Space complexity: O(1)

# ===== Stability =====
# - Stable: doesn't reorder equal elements
